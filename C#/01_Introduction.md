## C# vs .NET
C# is a programming language. DotNET is a developer platform that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library) and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run. It supports coding in C# and multiple other languages.

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the execution engine that handles running applications. It provides services like thread management, garbage collection, type safety, exception handling, and more. C# compiler compiles code to intermediate language code, which is platform agnostics (platform independent/ cross-platform) as long as it has CLR installed. The compiled IL code is stored in assemblies with .DLL or .EXE file extension. CLR will compile intermediate language code to native machine code, which called Just-In-Time compilation (JIT), when application runs.

.NET also contains class library, which provides a set of APIs and types for common functionallities.
